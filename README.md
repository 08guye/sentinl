> Kibana Alert App for Elasticsearch

---

Only a demo code from my gitbook <http://kibana.logstash.es/content/kibana/v4/plugin/server-develop.html> now.

## TODO

- [ ] Real email action.
- [ ] Webpage for editing alert rules.
- [ ] Record alert history into elasticsearch indices.
- [ ] Webpage for history view(maybe use kibana app?).
